# TRTS: Real Time Strategy

This project is my attempt at creating a multiplayer real time strategy game.
It is still in an early stage of development and, as a hobby project, it may never get finished.

The game is currently developed only for GNU/Linux systems (although it might be possible to make it run on 
other POSIX platforms).

## Building and running:

```
cmake .
make
./trts
```

(to test the multiplayer, you need to run multiple instances).
